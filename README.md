# Replication Guide  
This guide documents the data sources, variable construction, and step-by-step procedures used to build a firm-level AI measure from job postings and résumé data. Our methodology follows [Babina et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2300185X), and we replicate Figure 1(b) from the paper.  
## Job Postings  
In this section, we detail how we construct the firm-level AI measure from job-postings data. We begin with a description of the data, then outline the procedures and explain the purpose and functions of each code file. Finally, we present the replication results.
